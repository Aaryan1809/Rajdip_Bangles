AI Model Training Guide for Jewelry Classification
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a genuine AI model that can accurately classify your jewelry images. The current system in the app is just a placeholder that relies on filenames, which is not very reliable. By following these steps, you can build a much more intelligent system.

The Goal: From Keywords to True AI
Our goal is to replace the simple filename-checker with a custom image classification model. This model will learn the visual characteristics of your different jewelry types (what a bangle looks like vs. what an earring looks like) and make predictions based on the image itself, not the filename.

We'll use a free and incredibly user-friendly tool called Google's Teachable Machine. It lets you train a professional-quality model right in your browser.

Step 1: Gather and Organize Your Image Dataset
This is the most crucial step. The quality of your AI model depends entirely on the quality and quantity of the images you train it on.

Create a Main Folder: On your computer, create a new folder named Jewelry_Dataset.

Create Category Subfolders: Inside the Jewelry_Dataset folder, create a separate subfolder for each of your jewelry categories. The folder names must be exact:

Bangles

Kadas

Bracelets

Chains (Men)

Chains (Women)

Rings

Earrings

Populate the Folders: Now, fill these folders with your ornament images.

Quantity is Key: Aim for at least 50-100 high-quality images for each category. The more images you provide, the smarter your model will become.

Variety is Important: Use images with different backgrounds, lighting conditions, and angles. This helps the model learn to recognize the jewelry in various situations.

Your final folder structure should look like this:

Jewelry_Dataset/
├── Bangles/
│   ├── image001.jpg
│   ├── image002.png
│   └── ...
├── Kadas/
│   ├── image001.jpg
│   └── ...
├── Bracelets/
│   ├── ...
└── ... (and so on for all categories)

Step 2: Train Your Model with Teachable Machine
Now for the fun part! We will use your organized dataset to train the model.

Go to Teachable Machine: Open your web browser and navigate to Teachable Machine.

Start a New Project: Click on "Get Started" and then select "Image Project". Choose the "Standard image model" option.

Create Your Categories (Classes):

You will see a screen with "Class 1". Rename it to Bangles.

Click the "Upload" button and select all the images from your Bangles subfolder.

Click "Add a class" to create a new category. Name it Kadas and upload your images for that category.

Repeat this process for all your jewelry categories until each one has its own class filled with images.

Train the Model:

Once all your images are uploaded into their correct classes, click the "Train Model" button on the right.

Be patient! This process might take a few minutes. Teachable Machine is now "learning" from your images. Leave the tab open while it's training.

Test Your Model:

After training is complete, you will see a "Preview" panel.

You can test your new model's accuracy by uploading an image of a new piece of jewelry (one that wasn't in the training set). The model will instantly tell you which category it thinks the item belongs to!

Step 3: What's Next? (Integration)
Once you are happy with your model's performance in Teachable Machine, you can click the "Export Model" button. This will give you a shareable link and code snippets to integrate your new AI model into your website.

Replacing the old keyword-based function in the React app with your new Teachable Machine model is a more advanced step. For now, focus on creating a high-quality dataset and training an accurate model.

When you have a trained model you're happy with, we can then work on integrating it into your website in a future step!
